            <h2>From A Small Start To A Growing Local Brand</h2>
            <p>What began in 2023 as a side hustle for founder Louis Parer has grown through word-of-mouth, repeat business, and a genuine passion for restoring the look of homes and outdoor spaces. From day one, the focus has been simple: provide quality work, show up on time, communicate clearly, and leave every property looking noticeably better than before.</p>

            <h2>Service That Feels Professional And Personal</h2>
            <p>Louis discovered early that the work was about more than cleaning surfaces. It was about helping homeowners feel proud of their property again and building strong client relationships through dependable service. That client-first mindset remains central to every quote, every visit, and every completed job.</p>
